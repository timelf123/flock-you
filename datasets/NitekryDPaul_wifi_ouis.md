# Flock Safety WiFi OUIs — Research by @NitekryDPaul

**Researcher:** ØяĐöØцяöЪöяцฐ (**@NitekryDPaul**)

This dataset documents Flock Safety and related surveillance-infrastructure WiFi MAC-address OUIs (first three octets) discovered through 2.4 GHz promiscuous-mode analysis. All 30 prefixes below were identified by @NitekryDPaul during his promiscuous-mode research on Flock camera air traffic.

## Why promiscuous mode

Flock stations spend most of their duty cycle asleep, waking briefly to upload and then sleeping again. During the sleep windows a passive sniffer will never see them transmit — but it can still see them named as the **destination** (addr1) of probe responses and data frames from nearby APs. Matching on addr1 in addition to addr2 therefore reveals devices that a transmitter-only sniff would miss entirely.

This addr1 technique is @NitekryDPaul's discovery and is the basis of the `promiscuis-flock-you` firmware.

## OUI list (31 prefixes, lowercase, colon-separated)

@NitekryDPaul contributed the first 30. The 31st (`82:6b:f2`) was contributed
by **Michael / DeFlockJoplin** during follow-up drive-testing in Joplin — it's
the OUI of the 12th camera in his field test, which the original list didn't
catch. See [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## Detection strategy

For each observed 802.11 management or data frame:

1. Skip if multicast (addr1 byte 0 bit 0 set) — filters broadcasts, 33:33:* groups, etc.
2. Skip if locally-administered (byte 0 bit 1 set) — filters randomised MACs
3. Match `addr2` (transmitter) against the OUI list
4. Match `addr1` (receiver) against the OUI list — **the addr1 insight**
5. Optional: match `addr3` (BSSID) on mgmt frames when addr2 is randomised

### Wildcard-probe tightening (DeFlockJoplin)

Michael / DeFlockJoplin observed that Flock cameras channel-hop and spam
wildcard 802.11 Probe Requests on every channel. Combining that with the
OUI match yields a very tight signature:

1. Frame is Management, type=0 subtype=4 (Probe Request)
2. SSID Information Element (tag 0) is present with length 0
3. `addr2` (transmitter) matches the OUI list

Field-tested in Joplin: **11 of 12 cameras caught with only 2 false
positives**. The 12th camera used OUI `82:6b:f2`, which is now in the
list above. Source: [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## Firmware

The `promiscuis-flock-you` firmware implementing this research is a mod of @NitekryDPaul's promiscuous-mode firmware. It emits Flask-compatible JSON over USB for ingestion by the `flock-you` dashboard and persists detections to on-device SPIFFS.
